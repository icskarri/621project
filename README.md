# 621project
Course project for social networks and content analytics class.

The `castles.json`, `ornstein.json`, `romano.json`, `stone.json`, and `witness.json` files are the source Twitter data files. 

In the `code` folder, the `deals.R` file was used to create the `deals.csv` and `deals_fees.csv` files, both have already been uploaded for you.

The `report.Rmd` file is my project report and once run will render a version `report.html`.
